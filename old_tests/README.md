# Old Test Files

This folder contains deprecated test scripts and diagnostic tools that were used during development but are no longer actively maintained.

## Contents

- **test_*.py** - Various test scripts for notifications, reminders, secure links, etc.
- **diagnose_slack.py** - Slack integration diagnostics
- **send_test_message.py** - Manual Slack message testing
- **fix_orphaned_entries.py** - One-time script to fix orphaned queue entries
- **websocket_test.py** - WebSocket connection testing

These files are kept for reference but are not part of the active test suite.
The proper test suite is in `calendarEditor/tests/`.
